# Card Cache

## Trying to make a Redis/Pocketbase clone in Go for my own learning purposes.

### As the name suggests, this is a cache for storing key-value pairs in an in memory cache. I doubt I will add this to the Svoker codebase, unless it can outperform my existing Realtime subscriptions with PB. 
### Just think it would be really cool to build my own version to understand deep networking concepts and how Realtime DB's work!

### MVP would be a system where I can store game state in a cache and have multiple clients subscribe to the cache to get the latest game state.
